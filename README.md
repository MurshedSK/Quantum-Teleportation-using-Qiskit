## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the code implementation and the final seminar report for a project on **Quantum Teleportation**.

Quantum Teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender (Alice) to a receiver (Bob) without the physical transfer of the particle itself. Unlike sci-fi teleportation of matter, this protocol transfers the *state* of a qubit $|\psi\rangle$ using a shared entangled resource and a classical communication channel.

## 📄 Repository Contents

* **`QUANTUM_TELEPORTATION_USING_QISKIT.pdf`**: This file contains the Qiskit implementation.
* **`QUANTUM_TELEPORTATION_FINAL_SEMINAR_REPORT.pdf`**: The detailed seminar report covering historical background, mathematical theory (tensor products, density matrices), and the specific protocol.

## ⚛️ The Protocol

The implementation follows the standard circuit model described in the report:

1.  **Initialization:** A random qubit $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$ is generated by Alice.
2.  **Entanglement:** A Bell Pair (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair) is created and shared between Alice and Bob using Hadamard and CNOT gates.
3.  **Alice's Measurement:** Alice performs a Bell Basis Measurement on her message qubit and her half of the entangled pair, collapsing the state into one of four possibilities.
4.  **Classical Transmission:** Alice sends two classical bits of information to Bob.
5.  **Bob's Reconstruction:** Depending on the classical bits received, Bob applies specific Quantum Gates (Pauli-X or Pauli-Z) to recover the original state $|\psi\rangle$.

## 🛠️ Implementation & Results

The project uses the **Qiskit SDK** to simulate the protocol.

* **Simulator:** `statevector_simulator` is used to verify the fidelity of the state transfer.
* **Visualization:** The results are verified by comparing the **Bloch Sphere** and **Density Matrix** of the initial random state against Bob's final state.

### Verification
As shown in the notebook results, the density matrix of the teleported state perfectly matches the input state, confirming successful teleportation.
